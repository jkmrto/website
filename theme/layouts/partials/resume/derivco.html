		After being working for a tiny startup for almost three years I wanted to try some kind of bigger company and continue working with Elixir. That's why I decided to join Derivco which is the company that with more that 4.000 workers around the world is Software provider for Betway, one of the bigger sportbook around the world.

	At Derivco I was part of the Core team in charge of develop and mantain serveral service in Ruby, Elixir and Golang.
